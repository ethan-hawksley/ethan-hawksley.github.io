I've owned the domain name hawksley.dev for a while now, but I've never done much with it aside from sending e-mail. Over the weekend, I thought I might as well make good use of it and decided to create a blog.

In the beginning, this site had a humble home page with some links to GitHub projects. A blog requires much more infrastructure for me to use it effectively. For one, it'd be great if I could just write my posts in Markdown and have them formatted by my project automatically. Having a look at the options available, the first that stuck out was [GitHub's Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). It looked nice and had great integration with GitHub Pages, which is at the time of writing what I'm hosting with. However, it just felt too rigid and inflexible. I needed something modern that I felt I could get my hands dirty with.

Enter Astro.

## Why Astro

In the grand scheme of things, [the Astro framework](https://astro.build/) is pretty new at just 5 years old. That hasn't prevented it from gaining popularity rapidly. It holds performance as a key design principle, anything that can be static will render statically. By default, it ships absolutely no JS to the browser, which felt perfect for my use case. I have no need for advertising or heavy tracking scripts weighing down my site. All I need is a place to write.

Learning how to work with Astro was completely painless. I created a new GitHub repository and followed along with their very high-quality documentation to create a blog of my own. At the very end of it, I’d created a nice neat blog that loaded instantly and was easy to write for.

I wasn't satisfied by using the tutorial's blog for my site, though, as it felt too cookie cutter, and so I started again now with confidence in the framework.

## The Design Decisions

There were some definite design decisions I knew I wanted from the get-go. First-class light mode and dark mode support were a must. Plenty of blogs offered just one or the other, and after a bit of digging, it didn't seem hard to technically implement at all.

Another key principle was mobile-first design. Many of my previous projects started with the key assumption that the reader will be on a laptop or desktop, but that often isn't the case. Mobile devices account for approximately two-thirds of global internet traffic, with the remaining third coming from desktops. I wanted this site to stand the test of time until I inevitably rebuild it again, so it's only natural I designed it with mobile devices in mind.

My final decision I knew I wanted was to have excellent performance scores, one of the very reasons that I chose Astro for the job. Components are almost a certainty in modern web design to ensure consistency across pages, but I needed to write components used at compile time, rather than at run time.

## Actually Programming the Site

After creating an experimental fork of my main repository and wiping the directory, I initialised a new blank Astro project with `pnpm create astro@latest` and scaffolded the directory structure I'd need.

```bash
public // Assets such as robots.txt and favicons.
src
  assets // Any assets displayed in the actual site.
  components // Reusable components representing sections of UI.
  content // Markdown files representing the blog.
  layouts // The base layout each page uses.
  pages // The actual pages rendered, combining all parts together.
```

Development went very smoothly over two days and 15 full hours, with only some minor hiccups along the way.

Google's PageSpeed Insights flagged my planned accent colour International Orange `#FF4F00` as having insufficient contrast in light mode, so I had to split to separate accents for light and dark mode. By using global CSS variables that change depending on the theme, implementing this change was painless.

I also encountered some <abbr title="Content Layout Shift">CLS</abbr> issues surrounding my choice of font. I personally love the look of the [Inter font](https://rsms.me/inter/) and included it in my project. However, although 300 KiB may not sound like a lot, on a slow connection it’s a noticeable delay. After some research I discovered the [fontTools library](https://github.com/fonttools/fonttools) and managed to shrink down the Inter font to 70 KiB by subsetting the font to only include the character sets I need.

## The Conclusion

Astro has been a pleasure to work with, and I can easily see myself using it in future projects now I've adjusted to it.

[A perfect score](https://pagespeed.web.dev/analysis/https-hawksley-dev/x51rtffn8u?form_factor=mobile) has got to be one of the most satisfying feelings after doing a site redesign.
